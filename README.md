# mydotfiles backup folder

由于有同学恶魔一般地诱惑我重装了系统，使我不得不再次考虑备份问题，他不停地告诉我搞个dotfile存一下，最该死的是他说的还很对，所以之后把linux的个人文件都放在这里备份，以便不时之需。

Thanks to a classmate who devilishly persuaded me to reinstall my operating system, I found myself once again grappling with backup strategies. He kept insisting I create a dotfile folder for storage, and damn it, he was absolutely right. So now I'm backing up all my Linux personal files here, just in case I need them down the road.

`mydotfiles` lets you run some setupfiles on linux system, as every time you reinstall your operating system.

## What's Interesting

1. 为什么要对插入的图片添加 alt text？

    可访问性：屏幕阅读器可以为视障用户朗读图片描述

    SEO优化：搜索引擎能理解图片内容

    图片加载失败时：会显示 alt text 作为替代

2. 版本管理问题

    提交后发现log版本超前，继续学习版本管理

    📝 正确的工作流程
    逻辑顺序,开发工作 → commit → 再 release
    而不是：release → commit → 又 release ❌

## What's Next

I'm currently diving into the open source world, documenting interesting stuff I learn along the way, and actually building things instead of just talking about them. Since I juggle multiple development environments (that keep changing like a chameleon), I plan to level up this vintage file-backup project with some environment detection features.

## Solid Features supported

- [ ] environment detection scripts
- [ ] check and deploy scripts
- [ ] testing scripts
- [x] python conda vironment
- [x] deepin linux
- [x] MiPad tmoe linux
- [x] Server used
- [x] Windows Subsystem linux
