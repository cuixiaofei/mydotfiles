# mydotfiles backup folder

由于有同学恶魔一般地诱惑我重装了系统，使我不得不再次考虑备份问题，他不停地告诉我搞个dotfile存一下，最该死的是他说的还很对，所以之后把linux的个人文件都放在这里备份，以便不时之需。

As one of my classmates seduced me like a demon to reinstall my operating system, so I had to consider the backup problem again. He kept telling me to mkdir a "dotfile" folder, and the most important is what he said is definetely correct, so now the files are put here backup, in order to against a rainy day.
