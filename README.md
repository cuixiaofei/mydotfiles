# mydotfiles backup folder

As one of my classmate seduced me like a demon to reinstall my operating system, so I had to consider the backup problem again. He kept telling me to mkdir a "dotfile" folder, and the most important is what he said is definetely correct, so now the files are put here backup, in order to against a rainy day.
